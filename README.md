# 🛠 Roadmap to Become an AI Engineer

# ⏳ Suggested Timeline

(based on ~15h/week of study)

1. **`0–6 months** → Math + Python + ML basics`
2. **6–12 months** → Deep Learning + Projects
3. **1–2 years** → Specialization + Deployment skills
4. **2+ years** → Contribute to real-world AI products

# 📆 Roadmap with Years & Daily Hours

### **Phase 1 – Foundations (Math + Python + CS Basics)**

- **Duration**: 6–8 months
- **Daily time**: 2–3 hours
- **Focus**:
    - Math (linear algebra, probability, calculus)
    - Python programming
    - Data structures & algorithms

👉 By the end, you should be able to solve algorithm problems and write small Python projects.

---

### **Phase 2 – Core Machine Learning**

- **Duration**: 6–8 months
- **Daily time**: 3 hours
- **Focus**:
    - ML algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, trees, ensembles)
    - Scikit-Learn
    - Model evaluation
    - Small projects (predict housing prices, spam filter, recommendation system)

👉 After this, you can apply to entry-level *ML internships*.

---

### **Phase 3 – Deep Learning**

- **Duration**: 8–12 months
- **Daily time**: 3–4 hours
- **Focus**:
    - Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers
    - Frameworks: TensorFlow & PyTorch
    - Build projects (image classifier, chatbot, sentiment analysis)

👉 By the end, you can target *Junior AI Engineer roles*.

---

### **Phase 4 – Specialization + Deployment**

- **Duration**: 1 year
- **Daily time**: 2–4 hours
- **Focus**:
    - Specialization (NLP, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI)
    - Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
    - Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, MLOps)
    - Work on advanced real-world projects

👉 Now you’re job-ready for *AI Engineer* roles.

---

### **Phase 5 – Mastery (Long-term Growth)**

- **Duration**: Lifelong (after ~3–4 years you’ll be solid)
- **Daily time**: 1–2 hours (keep learning while working)
- **Focus**:
    - Research papers
    - Contributing to open-source AI projects
    - Building your own AI tools/products

---

## 🕒 Summary Timeline

- **0 – 1 year** → Math + Python + ML basics
- **1 – 2 years** → Deep learning + Projects
- **2 – 3 years** → Specialization + Deployment + Advanced projects
- **3 – 4 years** → Strong AI Engineer (job-ready anywhere)

---

⚖️ If you study:

- **2h/day** → Expect ~4–5 years to mastery
- **4h/day** → Expect ~2–3 years to mastery
